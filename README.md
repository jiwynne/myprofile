## Professional Summary

Senior Technical Writer and Documentation Specialist experienced in delivering high-impact technical content for global B2B, MedTech, FinTech, Software, and AI-driven organizations (which is pretty much all of them).

I specialize in creating clear, compliant, and scalable documentation ecosystems, from user manuals and quick-start guides to multilingual technical reference materials. My approach blends human precision with automation, using VBA scripting and foundational AI tools to streamline editing, proofing, and document control.

Over the years, I‚Äôve collaborated with cross-functional teams across Europe and Asia to produce documentation that meets ISO, GxP, and GAMP standards while staying readable and user-focused. I‚Äôm also experienced in Simplified Technical English/Italian and in developing controlled vocabularies to ensure linguistic consistency across product lines.

I‚Äôm passionate about integrating AI-assisted writing and process automation into the documentation workflow, helping companies move faster, improve accuracy, and reduce review overhead.

## Automated and Fully Customizable Proofing & Editing tools for Word
This is a tool I‚Äôve developed for MS Office to help with proofing and editing documentation from a technical writing perspective. 
It‚Äôs fully customizable‚Äîso it can be tailored for a company vocabulary, editing standards, and style. It dives deep into grammar, clarity, precision, and even catches things like wordiness and redundancy. Whether you're polishing internal docs or prepping content for publication, it‚Äôs designed to make your writing sharper, cleaner, and more professional.
